# Cell Segmentation

PyTorch implementation of several neural network segmentaion models (UNet, FusionNet, DialatedConvolution) for cell image segmentation. The trained model are uesd for the segmentation plugin [segmentify](https://github.com/transformify-plugins/segmentify) for [Napari](https://github.com/napari/napari)
